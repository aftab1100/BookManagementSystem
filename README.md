# Book Management System

- **View Book Details**: Users can view details of each book, including its title, author, year published, creation time, and last update time.
- **Edit Book**: Users can edit existing book details such as title, author, and year published.
- **Delete Book**: Users can delete books from the system after confirmation.
- **List Books**: Users can view a list of all books currently stored in the system.
